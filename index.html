    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>I am a highly motivated and professional individual who has found my true passion in software development. I have been using online resources such as Udemy, YouTube and Codecademy to work towards a career change, from analytical chemist to a full time software developer. 
    The focus of my learning journey so far has been front-end web development. I’ve found it to be a great introduction and from this, I aim to continuously expand my knowledge with new stack and new skills.
    <br>I live an active lifestyle and undertake hobbies such as snowboarding, bouldering and going to the gym. I believe looking after my physical health enables me to be more productive in my career by improving my mental health.</p>

    <h3>Work Experience </h3>      
    <p><b>Analytical Chemist, Luxfer MEL Technologies — 2017-Present</b>
    <br>
    My main duties consist of testing chemicals using different analytical techniques, reporting results, instrumental calibration and data analysis. For the data analysis, I draw data from Sharepoint spreadsheets and use Excel or PowerBI to visualise this.
    The analytical skills I have gained from this career I’ve found help problem solving when coding. <br> I have gained a level of patience and resilience which is beneficial when approaching hurdles in my code. 
    I have also gained many transferrable soft-skills during my science career such as teamwork, time-management, critical thinking, accountability and project management.</p>
