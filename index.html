<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>I am a highly motivated and professional individual who has found my true passion in software development. I have been using online resources such as Udemy, YouTube and Codecademy to work towards a career change, from analytical chemist to a full time software developer. 
  The focus of my learning journey so far has been front-end web development. I’ve found it to be a great introduction and from this, I aim to continuously expand my knowledge with new stack and new skills.
  I live an active lifestyle and undertake hobbies such as snowboarding, bouldering and going to the gym. I believe looking after my physical health enables me to be more productive in my career by improving my mental health.</p>

  My main duties consist of testing chemicals using different analytical techniques, reporting results, instrumental calibration and data analysis. I am also responsible for training new apprentices.
  The analytical skills I have gained from this career I’ve found help problem solving when coding. I have gained a level of patience and resilience which is beneficial when approaching hurdles in my code. 
  I have also gained many soft-skills during my science career such as teamwork, adaptability, critical thinking, accountability and project management.</p>
